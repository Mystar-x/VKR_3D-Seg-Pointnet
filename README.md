3. Complete a small segmentation case.

* **January plan:**
1. Write a program that implements the algorithm in the paper;
2. Train the model and test it on the dataset;
2. Try to optimize the problems of the algorithm, such as modifying the position of T-net;
3. Try to add other optimization algorithms in the last step to make the segmentation result more accurate.
